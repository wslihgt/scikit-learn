	* tests/test_fhmm.py (test_ghahramani_example_2chains): 
	for now, it seems the ghahramani tests are assessed as correct
	only for a rather high number of iterations of the variational
	algorithm (as of today: 14 tests, in 11.34s - so a bit long)

	* fhmm.py (GaussianFHMM._init): 
	commented: this should be done by parent class _init (from GaussianHMM).
	In particular, modified constructor so as to link 'tied' cvtype to 
	'variational' estimation method.

	* _hmmc.pyx (_logsum): creating _logsum_scale to reproduce scaling
	(_logsum): edit: removing _logsum_scale, _logsum actually seems to 
	do the job (avoid under/overflows)
