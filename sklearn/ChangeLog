	* fhmm.py (GaussianFHMM._init): 
	commented: this should be done by parent class _init (from GaussianHMM).
	In particular, modified constructor so as to link 'tied' cvtype to 
	'variational' estimation method.

	* _hmmc.pyx (_logsum): creating _logsum_scale to reproduce scaling
	(_logsum): edit: removing _logsum_scale, _logsum actually seems to 
	do the job (avoid under/overflows)
